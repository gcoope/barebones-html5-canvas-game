## Barebones HTML5 canvas game

Contains:

* Index.html
* css/style.css
* js/main.js
* js/tools.js
* RequestAnimationFrame.js

## Setup

This is a very simple structure, and it includes no external libraries. The code is all pretty self explanatory, most of your work will be done in main.js. Check what tools you have in tools.js before you begin.
